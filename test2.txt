    -- Method can be combined with acronym table method to further increase data capacity


 Introduction
    -- Information can be embedded in messages to avoid detection
    -- Low number of redundant spaces in written text makes embedding difficult
    -- Information hiding categories
        --- Synonym substitution
            ---- Replace words with previously enumerated synonyms to pass data bits
        --- Syntactic transformation
            ---- Switch active/passive tense of sentences to pass data bits
        --- Typographical errors
            ---- Insert typos to pass data bits
        --- Translation
            ---- Translation word choice to pass data bits
        --- Semantic transformation
            ---- Word sense disambiguation
- Previous work
    -- Acronym table used
    -- Abbreviated/non-abreviated words from table to represent ones and zeros
    -- Proposed method uses enumerated emoticons to pass data bits
- Proposed method
    -- Classify emoticons by meaning (smile, cry, etc.)
    -- Coordinate order and enumeration of emoticons for each meaning
    -- To send data, select emoticon whose number matches bits to be sent
    -- Extra data bits
        --- Two additional bits of data can be embedded based on context
        --- Placement of emoticon at beginning or end of message
        --- Placement of emoticon relative to punctuation
    -- Extraction
        --- Look up received emoticon in table to get data bits
- Experiments and Discussions
    -- Number of emoticons in each set affects data capacity
